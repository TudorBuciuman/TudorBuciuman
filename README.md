Light beamed into the world, but men and women ran toward the darkness, clutching their shadows as if they were heirlooms. The sky folded itself into a narrow corridor, and through it marched the procession of forgotten hours, each carrying a lantern that illuminated nothing but its own trembling flame.

After that, things were no longer happening so much as being remembered incorrectly. Cause and meaning drifted apart. Time loosened its grip and became something you could pass through without noticing, like fog that does not wet the skin but still chills the bone.

The world behaved as though it were being retold rather than lived. Directions were lost. What once descended now searched upward, unsure why. What endured began to murmur origins it could not verify.

Events occurred without witnesses, yet were never unwitnessed. Faces appeared, not attached to bodies, lingering just long enough to suggest recognition before withdrawing back into whatever had imagined them. Gifts changed hands without hands being involved. Acceptance and refusal no longer mattered; what was given remained given.

Somewhere a voice recited rules that did not resemble laws so much as habits of erasure. It spoke of beginnings that exhausted themselves too early, and conclusions that forgot how to conclude. It spoke of the first shadow, not as absence, but as invitation, so that the rest might only feel its echo.

Understanding tried to arrive and failed. Or perhaps it arrived and immediately dissolved. The moment turned inward on itself, folding until it revealed something fragile enough to break simply by being approached. Reaching for it was indistinguishable from losing it.

From then on, speech became cautious. Not because of fear, but because listening had changed. The world no longer overheard—it attended. And attention, once given, was not easily withdrawn.

Only at the end does it become clear that this was not merely happening.

That it was being carried.

That it was passing through a voice, worn thin by the telling.

I, too, have been touched by the devilish one. …oh, but when I saw the face of God, I was changed… Took the entire arm off.
